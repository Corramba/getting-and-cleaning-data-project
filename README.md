Cousera Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of the Project: create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The dataset being used is: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Files:
1. CodeBook.md: describes the data, variables and  any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data;
2. run_analysis.R: includes the code to perform the tasks described in the Project
3. tidy_data.txt: independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. the file created as a result of running run_analysis.R script
